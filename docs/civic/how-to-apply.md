# How to apply

To start integrating Civic Pass, the dApp domain has to be whitelisted with Civic's Secure Identity Platform so it can make requests to the Civic Gatekeeper.

To arrange this, contact sales@civic.com with some information about the dApp and the kind of identity criteria that has to be enforced.

If the dApp is built with React, the details of integrating with SIP can be handled by [Civic's React Component](./ui-integration.md).
